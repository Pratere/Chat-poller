### Motivation

As passionate followers of some of the top MLG pros in the industry, we came to a mutual understanding that the incoherent floods of scrambled replies to a Streamer's solicitation of information to their viewers.



### Purpose

##### Automated Live Polling Solution of the Future!

Dynopoll.io exists to serve as a solution to the problems that arise from live polling, whether it be Twitch, YouTube, IRC, etc. Our team of engineers and quality control specialists specially crafted this product to be as least intrusive to the viewers, and most intuitive to the streamer as possible.

### How is this Useful?

In popular chat rooms, such as busy Twitch's Fortnite Streams, a streamer may want input from the fans as to which song they should play while they own some n00bs, or which even something as simple as whether they should order pizza or chinese. These streamers have vast amount of followers, all eager to give their input. This may not be so bad if it is a binary question, but when there are many choices, the streamer will be flooded with replies faster than they can think. This will result in the streamer potentially making the less than optimal choice that will satisfy the most fans. Using our algorithm, we have the viewers take a poll and calculate the most desired choice. The streamer can gather this data and make the right decision. The fans will be happier, which then translates to more views in the future, which is the most important metric when determining revenue on these type of platforms.

### Target Audience

Although everyone can benefit from Dynopoll.io, our team of Mathematicians and Analysts have determined that users that draw in a viewcount of over 5,500 per stream see the most change.
